# Campus Recruitment App

## Features:-
1. We have a remote server database which stores the data of the student who
have registered through the Application. So whenever someone want to view his
/her profile he can do so using the app , the app fetches the individuals details
after authenticating him/her.

2. This password is stored in encrypted form in the database so if a person who
is not supposed to view the details of the student gets a peek at the database in
open state he won’t be able to figure out the actual password of the students.

3. We have allowed the user to enter all his details, and once he is sure that all
details are correct , he could confirm for the same and the details would be locked
from further modification. Though he would we allowed to update his profile picture
(limited max size) and resume whenever he wishes to.

4. Along with the Campus Recruitment android App, we have also made an
admin App to manage the database without actually going to the remote
Database.

5. Using the Admin app , we verify the registered students , view their details of
the students and add detail of the upcoming companies on the database from
where the recruitment application fetches this data and notifies the student about
the upcoming companies which are ”Open for Registration” , the stipend they are
giving , etc and also close the state of the company query in the database from
“Open for Registration” to “Closed ” state .

6. If an individual gets an intern, the admin could use the Application to update
this very detail to the individual’s records.

7. In the Recruitment App, we have used the MPAndroid horizontalbarChart to
show the stats of the current placement session.

8. Each time the user logs in through his account , he will get a notification
denoting the deadlines of the companies “Open for Registration”.

9. Students can share their interview experience and also view the experience of
other students.
